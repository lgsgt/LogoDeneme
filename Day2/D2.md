----
* **KEY TO THE TABLE ABOVE**
    * `Y` --> Feature can be done using this shell.
    * `N` --> Feature is not present in the shell.
    * `F` --> Feature can only be done by using the shells function mechanism.
    * `L` --> The readline library must be linked into the shell to enable this Feature.


----
* **NOTES TO THE TABLE ABOVE**

    * `1` This feature was not in the orginal version, but has since become
       almost standard.
    * `2` This feature is fairly new and so is often not found on many
       versions of the shell, it is gradually making its way into
       standard distribution.
    * `3` The Vi emulation of this shell is thought by many to be
       incomplete.
    * `4` This feature is not standard but unoffical patches exist to
       perform this.
    * `5` A version called 'pdksh' is freely available, but does not have
       the full functionality of the AT&T version.
    * `6` This can be done via the shells programmable completion mechanism.
    * `7` Only by specifing a file via the ENV environment variable.

**Bourne Compatible Shells**

* **sh**, is the original Bourne Shell.On many non-Linux Systems this is an old shell without the POSIX features. Thus bash and ksh(csh/tcsh) are better choice than sh. On same system thoughs sh is really the same as bash or ksh.

* **bash**, is the GNU Bourne-Again Shell. It is mostly Bourne-Compatible and has other useful extensions. It is the default on most Linux Systems. If it is not the default, it is probably installed on Linux and can also installed on non-Linux Systems.

* **ksh**, Public Domain Korn Shell. AT&T ksh was a commercial shell. It has a lot of features of pdksh, plus the ksh93 version has several interesting  extensions different from bash. It is licensed under an open source licence since 2005.

* **mksh**, is the MirBSD enhanced version of Public Domain Korn Shell (Pdksh).

* **ash**, the Almquist shell, is a POSIX compliant shell that is much smaller than bash. It is the default  shell in multiple BSD variants. Its variant Debian Almquist Shell(dash) is the default shell in Debian and Ubuntu Linux distributes for execution of shell as opposed to interactive use.

* **csh**, BSD introduced the C shell, which sometimes resembles slightly the C programming language. This shell is csh. The shell tcsh is csh with more features. These shells are NOT-Bourne-Compatible. Many of features where  later added to Bourne Compatible shells. If csh of tcsh is your default shell, you might benefit vy using bash or ksh to get Bourne-Compatibility and POSIX features.
